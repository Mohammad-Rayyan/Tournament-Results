## Overview
This is the fourth project from udacity full-stack web developer nanodegree.
based on:
* Intro to relational database course.

## Description
In this project, weâ€™ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.
The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.
This project has two parts:
1. defining the database schema (SQL table definitions).
2. writing the code that will use it.

## How to use
1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox.
2. Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository.
3. Launch the Vagrant VM.
4. Write SQL database and table definitions in a file (tournament.sql).
5. Write Python functions filling out a template of an API (tournament.py).
6. Run a test suite to verify your code (tournament_test.py).
